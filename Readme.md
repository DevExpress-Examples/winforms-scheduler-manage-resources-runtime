# How to manage scheduler resources at runtime


<p>This example shows how you can manage scheduler resources at runtime. The Scheduler context menu is modified to include commands to create, modify or delete selected resource. To invoke the menu, right-click any region of SchedulerControl (except appointments). A custom form is invoked that enables you to set caption, color and image for the selected resource.</p>
